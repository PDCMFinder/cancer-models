In the complex realm of patient-derived cancer models (PDCMs), including PDX, organoids, and cell lines, finding the right model and associated data has been a formidable challenge. Researchers, clinicians, and bioinformaticians have struggled to navigate this vast landscape, hindered by a lack of shared data standards.

CancerModels.Org is here to simplify this process. We harmonise and integrate critical model attributes, offering a unified platform for efficient searching across diverse resources. Building on the success of the PDX Finder resource (PMID:30535239) and the PDX Minimal Information standard (PDX-MI, PMID: 29092942), we're dedicated to enabling seamless data exchange and accelerating cancer research.

## Why Submit Your Data to CancerModels.Org:

Submitting your data to CancerModels.Org offers several benefits:

- Increased Visibility: Your data becomes more discoverable and visible to researchers and other users.
- Standardisation: Your models adhere to published standards, making it easier for researchers to search and compare them.
- Adherence to FAIR principles: Your data is structured to adhere with the FAIR data principles, which means it's Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.
- Attribution: Clear links to production centres are provided, so users can inquire about obtaining your models for their studies.
- Free Access: CancerModels.Org is a community-driven platform that's free for both data providers and users.

## Eligibility

CancerModels.Org welcomes data submissions from a wide range of contributors, including individual researchers, institutional biobanks, contract research organisations, external databases and consortia engaged in cancer research. While there are no stringent eligibility criteria or qualifications, data providers should have legitimate and scientifically valuable patient-derived cancer model data to share and adhere to ethical and legal guidelines related to patient consent, data privacy, and data sharing.
