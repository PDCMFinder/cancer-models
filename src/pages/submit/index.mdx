In the complex realm of patient-derived cancer models (PDCMs), including PDX, organoids, and cell lines, finding the right model and associated data has been a formidable challenge. Researchers, clinicians, and bioinformaticians have struggled to navigate this vast landscape, hindered by a lack of shared data standards.

CancerModels.Org is here to simplify this process. We harmonise and integrate critical model attributes, offering a unified platform for efficient searching across diverse resources. Building on the success of the PDX Finder resource <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30535239/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PMID:30535239</a> and the PDX Minimal Information standard (PDX-MI, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29092942/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PMID:29092942</a>), we're dedicated to enabling seamless data exchange and accelerating cancer research.

## Why Submit Your Models and Data to CancerModels.Org:

- Increased Visibility: Your models and associated data becomes more discoverable to researchers and other users.
- Standardisation: Your models adhere to published standards, making it easier for researchers to search and compare them.
- Adherence to FAIR principles: Your data is structured to adhere to the <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">FAIR data principles</a>, which means it's Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.
- Attribution: Clear links to production centres are provided, so users can inquire about obtaining your models for their studies.
- Free Access: CancerModels.Org is a community-driven platform that's free for both model providers and users.

## Eligible models and associated data

CancerModels.Org aggregates models from individual researchers, institutional biobanks, contract research organisations, external databases and consortia engaged in cancer research focusing on models from rare cancers and richly annotated models. All models and data should adhere to ethical and legal guidelines related to patient consent, data privacy, and data sharing. Since 1 January 2023 all model and data submissions are made available under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CC0</a>.
