Patient-derived cancer models have become an essential tool in both cancer research, drug development and preclinical studies. Each model type - PDX, organoid and cell line - offers unique advantages and is better suited for specific research areas.

Researchers, clinicians, bioinformaticians and analytical tool developers face the challenge of navigating a complex landscape to find suitable models and associated data across multiple commercial and academic resources without the benefit of shared data standards or interoperable data. CancerModels.Org aims to solve this problem by providing harmonized and integrated model attributes to support consistent searching across the originating resources.

CancerModels.Org builds on the success of the PDX Finder resource [PMID:30535239](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30535239/) and PDX Minimal information standard (PDX-MI, [PMID: 29092942](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29092942/)). PDX-MI has become established in the community for data exchange, adopted by the PDX providers, consortia and informatic tools integrating PDX data.

We are working with the community on Minimal Information standards for other patient-derived cancer models in an effort to make all datasets adhere to the [FAIR data principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).
