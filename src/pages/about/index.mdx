Patient-derived cancer models have become an essential tool in both cancer research, drug development and preclinical studies. Each model type - PDX, organoid and cell line - offers unique advantages and is better suited for specific research areas.

Researchers, clinicians, bioinformaticians and analytical tool developers face the challenge of navigating a complex landscape to find suitable models and associated data across multiple commercial and academic resources without the benefit of shared data standards or interoperable data. CancerModels.Org aims to solve this problem by providing harmonized and integrated model attributes to support consistent searching across the originating resources.

CancerModels.Org builds on the success of the PDX Finder resource [PMID:30535239](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30535239/) and PDX Minimal information standard (PDX-MI, [PMID: 29092942](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29092942/)). PDX-MI has become established in the community for data exchange, adopted by the PDX providers, consortia and informatic tools integrating PDX data.

We are working with the community on Minimal Information standards for other patient-derived cancer models in an effort to make all datasets adhere to the [FAIR data principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).

## Licence

All cancermodels.org model and data submissions are available under CC0 or EMBL-EBI terms of use. Since 1st January 2023, we have been asking model providers to agree to share their data under the terms of CC0. This dedicates the data to the public domain, allowing downstream users to consume the data without restriction. Metadata and data submitted prior to 1 January 2023 are made available under the EMBL-EBI terms of use. Whilst these terms do not themselves impose any restrictions on downstream use, the application of CC0 licence removes any ambiguity. We advise users of cancermodels.org to note the licence terms of individual datasets, if applicable to their specific use case. The licence terms are accessible from the individual model pages. Please ensure that the original data are cited whenever they are used in a publication.
