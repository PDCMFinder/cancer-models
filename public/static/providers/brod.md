Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard was launched in 2004 to empower this generation of creative scientists to transform medicine. The Broad Institute seeks to describe all the molecular components of life and their connections; discover the molecular basis of major human diseases; develop effective new approaches to diagnostics and therapeutics; and disseminate discoveries, tools, methods, and data openly to the entire scientific community.

Founded by MIT, Harvard, Harvard-affiliated hospitals, and the visionary Los Angeles philanthropists Eli and Edythe L. Broad, the Broad Institute includes faculty, professional staff, and students from throughout the MIT and Harvard biomedical research communities and beyond, with collaborations spanning over a hundred private and public institutions in more than 40 countries worldwide.

The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard has been awarded one of two research subcontracts by Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., which operates the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research. The subcontract is for a Cancer Model Development Center (CMDC), which will produce 150 patient-derived cancer cell models as part of the Human Cancer Models Initiative (HCMI). The HCMI is an international collaboration between the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in the United Kingdom (UK), Cancer Research UK, and the Hubrecht Organoid Technology foundation in the Netherlands to build approximately 1,000 new genomically characterized, clinically annotated cancer organoid and cancer cell models that can be easily accessed by researchers worldwide to propel the development of new treatments.
