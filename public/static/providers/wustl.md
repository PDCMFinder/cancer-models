The National Cancer Institute (NCI) launched the PDX (patient-derived PDXs) Development and Trial Centers Research Network (PDXNet) in September, 2017 to accelerate translational research using PDX datasets. The PDXNet comprises of four PDX Development and Trial Centers (PDTCs) and the PDX Data Commons and Coordinating Center (PDCCC).

The overall goal of the WU-PDTC is to exploit the translational potential of PDX models for evaluating the response of various treatments in models with specific molecular characteristics. As PDX models more faithfully reproduce human cancer than cell lines, they can contribute to the ultimate clinical implementation of cancer precision medicine. We have developed a large collection of PDX models across 12 major cancer types, including colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, and sarcomas. [...
