The National Cancer Institute Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium (NCI PPTC) addresses key challenges associated with the development of new therapies for children with cancer by developing reliable preclinical testing data for pediatric drug candidates that can be used to inform new agent prioritization decisions.

The PPTC PDX Resource contains 261 PDX models from 37 unique pediatric cancers that demonstrate faithful recapitulation of histologies and subtypes. The genomes of engrafted tumors are characterized using whole-exome, whole-transcriptome, SNP genotyping arrays, and STR profiling.

The models here are biased toward the most highly aggressive pediatric cancers and shows a faithful recapitulation of primary and relapsed disease within tumor of origin type through analysis of somatic mutations, copy number alterations, RNA expression, gene fusions, and oncogenic pathways. The genomic annotations will enable rational preclinical agent prioritization and acceleration of therapeutic targets for early-phase pediatric oncology clinical trials.
