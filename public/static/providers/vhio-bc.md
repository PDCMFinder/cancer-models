VHIO is a leading comprehensive cancer center of excellence where its scientists and physicians adopt a purely translational research model, working together as multidisciplinary teams to both accelerate and advance personalized and targeted therapies against cancer.

We have generated an extensive experimental resource of PDXs from primary and metastatic breast tumours, aiming to tackle drug resistances and find new therapies.
