The Istituto Nazionale Tumori-IRCCS Fondazione G. Pascale is a highly specialized hospital and research institute in the field of oncology.

As IRCCS (title granted by the Italian Ministry of Health to biomedical institutions of relevant national interest), the mission of Pascale Institute is the development of translational research on cancer combining research activities (both preclinical and clinical) with high-complexity and high- quality care services, it stands as one of the most significant healthcare entities in Southern Italy in the field of oncology. The National Cancer Institute serves as the regional reference center for the diagnosis and treatment of neoplastic diseases.
The mission of Experimental Pharmacology Unit is mainly the preclinical and clinical development of new anti-tumor therapeutic approaches, aiming to improve treatment efficacy, reducing their toxicity and quickly translating them to patient care.

Research can be summarized as follows:
1. New pharmacological combinations, using epigenetic drugs and repositioning drugs;
2. Use of complex preclinical models (3D tumor/TME cultures/co-cultures; immune-competent models; PDX);
3. Use of high throughput and high-content screening;
4. Identification of new prognostic and/or predictive markers of response using flow cytometry, Seahorse flux analysis, metabolomics, lipidomics and proteomics, isolation of extra-cellular vesicles and systems biology;
5. “In silico” analysis (molecular modeling and virtual screening).
