Established in 2006, the Vall d’Hebron Institute of Oncology (VHIO) is a leading comprehensive cancer center of excellence where its scientists and research physicians adopt a purely translational research model, working together as multidisciplinary teams to both accelerate and advance personalized and targeted therapies against cancer. Undertaking one of Spain´s most dynamic cancer research programs, VHIO is dedicated to delivering on the promise of precision medicine in oncology – turning cancer discovery into more effective treatments and better practice for the care of our patients.

[The Stem Cells and Cancer Group at VHIO](http://www.vhio.net/en/stem-cells-and-cancer-group) has developed a collection of PDX models derived from primary tumors or liver metastasis. We have also generated clinical trial associated xenografts (CTAX) from patients enrolled in early phase trials with new experimental drugs. Our collection is partially annotated for clinical, mutational and gene expression data.

The [Vall d’Hebron Institute of Oncology](http://www.vhio.net/en/) is a member of the [EurOPDX Consortium](http://www.europdx.eu) . EurOPDX is supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the grant agreement No. 731105 [EDIReX](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/212589_en.html).
