The Pre-clinical investigation laboratory at the Curie Institute (LIP) has 25 years experience in developing patient-derived PDXs of a wide range of cancers including breast, colon, lung, ovary, uveal melanoma, retinoblastoma, Head and Neck cancers.

The Pre-clinical investigation laboratory is developing the next generation of PDX models, from drug-resistant tumors, metastatic cancer to humanized models. LIP services includes:

- Preclinical pharmacology & pharmacodynamics of anti-cancer drugs
- Identification of predictive biomarkers of response and resistance to anti-cancer agents
- Collaboration with many national and European academics & pharmaceutical companies [Read more](https://science.institut-curie.org/platforms/pre-clinical-investigation-laboratory-lip/)

We have established a collection of heterotopic ovarian cancers PDXs.

The Pre-clinical investigation laboratory is a member of the [EurOPDX Consortium](http://www.europdx.eu). EurOPDX is supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the grant agreement No. 731105 [EDIReX](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/212589_en.html)
