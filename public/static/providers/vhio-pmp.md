Héctor G. Palmer’s Stem Cells & Cancer Group studies the mechanisms that enable tumors to persist by evading effective treatments and progressing to advanced stages of disease.

We study the mechanisms underlying the persistence of cancer cells that enable tumors to evade effective therapies and progress to advanced stages of disease.

Using multi-omics approaches we aim to unravel unexpected alterations linked to tumor and single cell phenotypes. Combining gene editing (CRISPR/Cas) with classical signaling biochemistry in cancer cell lines as well as genetically modified mice, patient-derived organoids (PDO) and xenografts (PDX), our group focuses on the functional relevance of these newly identified alterations in patients’ response to treatment.

We participate in a global and multidisciplinary task force incorporating medical oncologists, surgeons, radiologists, and nurses. We work closely together to rapidly translate laboratory results to the clinic.
