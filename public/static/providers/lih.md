Within the Luxembourg Institute of Health (LIH), the NORLUX Neuro-Oncology laboratory is specialized in brain tumor research with a major emphasis on the biology of malit gliomas, in particular the most aggressive form - Glioblastoma. NORLUX aims to translate acquired research-based knowledge into preclinical and clinical applications.

[The NORLUX laboratory](https://norlux.lih.lu) have a longstanding expertise in generating brain tumor patient-derived orthotopic xenografts (PDOXs). Glioma PDOXs are derived from 3D organoid cultures established from patient tumor tissue, followed by an efficient orthotopic xenografting. We have developed > 40 Glioblastoma xenografts, including longitudinal models from patients prior and after treatment. We also established PDOXs from grade III/IV gliomas carrying IDH1 R132H mutation. We have performed a detailed molecular and morphological characterization, including histopathological assessment, genetic aberrations and mutations (array-CGH, targeted DNA sequencing), DNA methylation and gene expression. NORLUX models are applicable for preclinical drug testing in vitro (3D organoids) and in vivo.

NORLUX is a member of the [EurOPDX Consortium](http://www.europdx.eu). EurOPDX is supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the grant agreement No. 731105 [EDIReX](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/212589_en.html).
