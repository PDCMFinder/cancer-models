The growth factors laboratory at Vall dâ€™Hebron Institute of Oncology (VHIO) in Barcelona, Spain, has generated an extensive collection of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) of different tumor types with main focus in Breast and Pancreatic Cancer. In addition, we are interested in the development and characterization of immunotherapies for which we have developed a platform for Humanized PDX models (Sci Transl. Med, 2018). These models and the developed expertise in humanized models have shown to be instrumental to contribute to the discovery and characterization of novel factors and mechanisms governing malit progression.

We have generated a resource of >20 Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma and >15 Cholangiocarcioma PDX models from primary and metastatic sites. Studies on our Pancreatic Cancer models have contributed to characterize resistances to targeted therapies based on Mek inhibition [(Pedersen, K. et al Oncogene, 2017)](https://www.nature.com/articles/onc2017174)
