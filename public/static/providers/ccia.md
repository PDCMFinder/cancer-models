Professor Lock's group at the Children's Cancer Institute (Sydney, Australia) is one of the consortium member and the principal focus of the group is to study the development and utilization of orthotopic patient-derived xenograft models of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) to study the biology and treatment of these diseases. Professor Lock's laboratory has developed approximately one hundred patient-derived xenograft models that encompass high-risk pediatric ALL subtypes, and these models are considered to be highly reflective of the clinical disease state. The xenograft models have been utilized to study mechanisms of resistance to conventional drugs, as well as to prioritize new drugs for clinical trials in relapsed/refractory pediatric ALL, and they will be used by the Lock laboratory in testing novel anti-leukemia agents through the PIVOT. ...
