Charles River offers more than 450 fully characterized proprietary patient-derived xenografts (PDX Models) in our portfolio, which represent all major histotypes and tumors, and provide extensive background and characterization.

By leveraging the wealth of information that we have on each tumor model, we can help you with your study and provide suggested patient-derived xenograft (PDX models) to test. We currently have more than 450 fully characterized proprietary patient-derived xenografts in our portfolio, which represent all major histotypes and tumors, and provide extensive background and characterization.

Our PDX Model portfolio includes:

- Subcutaneous, [orthotopic](https://www.criver.com/products-services/discovery-services/vivo-pharmacology/oncology-pharmacology-models/orthotopic-models), and disseminated models of cancer
- Extensive molecular and pharmacological characterization, and complete records on patientsâ€˜ pretreatment
- Integrated approach using the same PDX models and/or the corresponding cell line
- Integrated approach using the same PDX models and/or the corresponding cell line
