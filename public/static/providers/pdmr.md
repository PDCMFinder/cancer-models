The NCI Patient-Derived Models Repository is a national repository of patient-derived xenografts developed from patients with solid tumors.

The NCI Patient-Derived Models Repository (PDMR) models are clinically-annotated with molecular information available in an easily accessible database for the extramural community. Tissue and blood samples from patients with cancer (primary and metastatic; treatment naïve and pre-treated) have been collected from over 50 comprehensive cancer centers, clinical trials networks, and rapid autopsy programs across the US for model generation. PDXs are primarily generated by subcutaneous implantation of fresh tumor tissue using NOD scid gamma host mice. The PDMR’s goal is to have at least 1000 PDX models available to researchers to power research studies including target qualification, pharmacodynamic biomarker development, and preclinical efficacy studies. In the future, release matched early-passage mixed tumor, cancer-associated fibroblast, and organoid cultures. The PDMR histologically evaluates all PDX tumors that contribute to its distribution material and molecularly characterizes multiple PDXs within each model as well as the patient material when available [...
