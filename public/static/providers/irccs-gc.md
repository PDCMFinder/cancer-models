Researchers at the University of Torino, Italy, aim at identifying new molecular target in gastric cancer.

We have produced an extensive experimental resource of PDXs from primary gastro-esophageal tumors, coupled with molecular annotation including HER2 (HercepTest ), MSI, EBV status and Targeted/Whole exome sequencing. This platform enables population-level discovery of genetic and functional vulnerabilities, which can be targeted in preclinical xenotrials.

The Candiolo Cancer Institute is a member of the [EurOPDX Consortium](http://www.europdx.eu). EurOPDX is supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the grant agreement No. 731105 [EDIReX](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/212589_en.html)
