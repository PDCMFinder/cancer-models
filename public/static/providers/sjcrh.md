The Developmental Biology and Solid Tumor Program created the Childhood Solid Tumor Network (CSTN) to accelerate discovery and improve outcomes for children with solid tumors. All samples and data are shared free of charge with no obligation to collaborate even for unpublished samples and data.

The mission of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital is to advance cures, and means of prevention, for pediatric catastrophic diseases through research and treatment. [The Childhood Solid Tumor Network\\n (CSTN)](http://www.stjude.org/cstn) was created to share resources and data to stimulate basic research and speeding translation to the clinic. The CSTN houses hundreds of orthotopic patient derived xenografts (O-PDXs) from more than 20 different types of pediatric solid tumors. Importantly, all patients consented to donate their tumor tissue for xenografting and profiling. All samples and data are shared free of charge with no obligation to collaborate.

The following resources are available:

- [Viable tumor cells or orthotopic implantation](https://cstn.stjude.cloud)
- [SOP and protocols for processing and implanting tumors](https://cstn.stjude.cloud/resources)
- Cryopreserved specimens for molecular analyses
- FFPE blocks or sections are available
- [Characterization data including WGS, WES of patient tumor, normal germline and O-PDX](https://platform.stjude.cloud/data/cohorts?dataset_accession=SJC-DS-1008)
- RNA-seq of patient tumor and O-PDX
- WGBS or 850k methylation array of patient tumor and O-PDX
- Clonal analysis of patient tumor and O-PDX
- Histopathology of patient tumor and O-PDX
- Electron microscopy of patient tumor (when available) and O-PDX
- Single nucleus RNA-seq of patient tumor and O-PDX
- ChIP-seq of O-PDX for 8 histone marks, Brd4, CTCF and RNA PolII
- Proteomics and phosphoproteomics of selected O-PDX tumors
- Transcriptome and epigenetic profiling of associated normal tissue
- [Pharmacokinetic data using the O-PDX to measure drug penetration and system exposure for more than 30 drugs](https://cstn.stjude.cloud/resources)
