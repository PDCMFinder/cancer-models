Researchers at the Princess Margaret (PM) Cancer Centre (Toronto, Canada) have clinically annotated and molecularly characterized tumor models (>1000) including ovarian, head and neck, lung, mesothelioma, breast, pancreas and colon cancers. These patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models are grown in immune-deficient mice to study the genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity of these tumors, and to better understand the functional significance of their molecular changes.

The Princess Margaret Living Biobank (PMLB) research core facility acts as a repository for REB-approved and patient consented PDX models and their associated multi-omics and clinicopathological data. PM scientists collaborate with the PMLB to make these models available to researchers at academic institutions and commercial companies. PMLB provides services including model establishment, drug screening, functional screening and biomarker discovery. [... Read more](https://www.livingbiobank.ca/)
