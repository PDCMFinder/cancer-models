The Mario Negri Institute of Pharmacological Research IRCCS comprises 12 departments: 8 are locatedat the headquarters in Milan and 4 are in the headquarters in Bergamo and Ranica (BG). In addition to its experimental research, the institute carries out intensive clinical research that involves designing, coordinating and participating in numerous clinical trials and creating and managing disease registers.

The institute conducts scientific research with the aim of improving human health. The work begins by taking stock of the problems that patients face, then moves to experimental models – at the cellular and molecular level – and then the focus returns to patients.

Researchers study all components of drugs, identify organisms’ mechanisms of action, the causes of the onset of diseases and organisms’ responses to drugs exposure. The institute also evaluates the efficacy of health interventions, and of training and information dissemination activities aimed at the general public.
