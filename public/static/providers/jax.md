Over 450 patient-derived PDX (PDX) models for more than 20 different cancer types engrafted in immunodeficient NSG™ mice are available for shipment to your facility or for dosing studies conducted by the JAX In Vivo Pharmacology Services team.

The JAX PDX Resource contains over 450 patient-derived PDX (PDX) models for more than 20 different cancer types which have been engrafted in immunodeficient NSG ™ mice. Models have curated clinical and patient demographic annotations, including patient treatment history. The genomes of engrafted tumors are characterized using targeted gene sequencing, transcriptional profiling, and copy number variation. Many of the models in the JAX resource have been tested for response to standard of care therapies.

Features of JAX models include:

1. models generated from clinical samples, not cell lines
2. models from diverse cancer types that reflect a spectrum of mutations/genomic configurations
3. genomic and dosing data based on early passage samples (> 6 passages) to retain tumor heterogeneity
