The [Cell Model Passports](https://cellmodelpassports.sanger.ac.uk/) is the data hub of the [Cancer Dependency Map](https://depmap.sanger.ac.uk/) at [The Wellcome Sanger Institute](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/). This project aims to identify vulnerabilities in every cancer cell which could be exploited to develop new therapies. The Cancer Dependency Map is a strategic collaboration between the Wellcome Sanger Institute (Cambridge, UK) and the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/) (Boston, USA).

The Cell Model Passports contains genomic and functional datasets as well as curated patient and sample information for over 1500 cancer cell models. The majority of models within the resource have undergone extensive characterisation including: sequencing, copy number, methylation, gene expression, drug and genetic perturbation. These datasets support researchers to understand the relationships between genetic alterations and subsequent vulnerabilities allowing the identification of novel drug targets and genetic markers for patient selection.
