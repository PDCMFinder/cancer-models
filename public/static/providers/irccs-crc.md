Researchers at the University of Turin, Italy, aim at exploring the mechanisms of tumor dependency on oncogenic drivers and at understanding how such dependency is affected by genomic or functional modifiers, with an emphasis on colorectal cancer (CRC).

We have produced an extensive experimental resource of PDXs from primary and metastatic colorectal tumours, coupled with comprehensive molecular annotation including whole exome and cancer panel targeted sequencing as well as methylation profiles and gene expression.This platform enables population-level discovery of genetic and functional vulnerabilities, which can be targeted in preclinical xenotrials.

The Candiolo Cancer Institute is a member of the [EurOPDX Consortium](http://www.europdx.eu). EurOPDX is supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the grant agreement No. 731105 [EDIReX](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/212589_en.html).
