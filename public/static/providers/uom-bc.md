Researchers at the University of Manchester use advanced _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ preclinical models to investigate early and metastatic human breast cancer leading to the development of new strategies or targets for prevention of advanced breast cancer.

We have produced an experimental resource of 12 PDXs from primary and metastatic breast tumours that we have shown to maintain histopathological features and genetic profiles of the original patient tumours.
