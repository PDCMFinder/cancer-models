IDI-IRCCS is a dermatologic institute that represents a national and international reference center for clinicians and researchers in the field of skin and epithelia physio-pathology. In addition to its well-established healthcare services, IDI-IRCCS places significant emphasis on scientific research. This research integrates pre-clinical, clinical, and healthcare studies, aiming to translate findings into innovative and updated diagnostic and therapeutic methods for patients.
The experimental research primarily focuses on the molecular mechanisms underlying various dermatological conditions, including genetic and autoimmune diseases, chronic inflammatory diseases, ulcerative skin conditions, and skin cancers. Much of the laboratory research is closely linked to clinical practice and utilizes biological material derived from patients.

The studies conducted in the Molecular Oncology Laboratory of IDI-IRCCS explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis and progression of melanoma, with a focus on identifying potential biomarkers predictive of response and resistance to antitumor agents. As part of this work, the laboratory has created a resource of stabilized cell lines derived from patient melanoma metastases.

In the field of oncology, IDI-IRCCS is a member of the Ministry of Health's network of oncology IRCCS centers, "Alliance Against Cancer" (ACC).
