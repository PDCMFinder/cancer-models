Our approach relies on our expertise in obtaining clinical specimens to use for patient-derived models. We recently established the Melbourne Urology Research Alliance (MURAL) platform of preclinical models and have world class facilities to support our specific projects. We are leading contributors to national and international networks and collaborations, integrating and co-ordinating our outcomes worldwide.

Specifically, our program projects seek to improve diagnosis of localised prostate cancer by:

- Determining the origins of high risk disease, particularly neuroendocrine tumours
- Using sub pathologies (e.g. intraductal carcinoma of the prostate, IDC-P) to identify high risk patients and improve prognosis in both sporadic and familial prostate cancer.

Specifically, our program projects seek to test new treatments for CRPC including:

- Novel therapies targeting the androgen receptor
- Ribosome directed therapies
- Epigenome targeted therapies
- Therapies targeting DNA damage repair.

If successful, we will improve the accuracy of identifying patients with high risk localised disease that may in turn inform the design of upfront therapy trials. Also, we will identify novel treatments that can eradicate CRPC tumours in preclinical tests to guide new and ongoing clinical trials.
