The Cancer Biomarkers Laboratory at the Fondazione IRCCS Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza (CSS) uses a combination of genomic (e.g., RNA-seq, scRNA seq, miRNA-seq, qRT-PCR array plates), computational and functional approaches (high-throughput genetic screening, shMIMICS library) to analyze lung cancer transcriptome in primary and commercial cell lines as well as in human tumor samples (fresh and FFPE), and to identify tumor and circulating (plasma) biomarkers to explore molecular mechanisms of lung cancer progression and improve diagnosis and prognosis.

The Hematopathology Laboratory at the Fondazione IRCCS Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza  (CSS) employs a combinatorial experimental approach including synthetic human models of T-cell leukemia, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, multiparameter flow cytometry, ChIP-seq, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq), AbSeq and gain/loss-of-function assays through lentiviral gene transduction and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, to decipher the properties of leukemic and hematopoietic progenitors responsible for the generation and propagation of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).
