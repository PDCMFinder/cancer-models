The [Human Cancer Models Initiative](https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/HCMI) (HCMI) is an international collaboration between the [US National Cancer Institute](https://www.cancer.gov/) (NCI) – part of the [National Institutes of Health](https://www.nih.gov/) (NIH), [Cancer Research UK](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/funding-for-researchers/how-we-deliver-research/our-research-partnerships/human-cancer-models-initiative) (CRUK), [Wellcome Sanger Institute](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/collaboration/human-cancer-model-initiative-hcmi/) (WSI), and foundation [Hubrecht Organoid Technology](https://hub4organoids.eu/) (HUB). The goal of HCMI is to create patient-derived Next-generation Cancer Models (NGCMs) such as organoids, conditionally reprogrammed cells, neurospheres, or optimal growth condition models as a community resource. HCMI aims to provide the models’ case-associated data, which includes quality-checked clinical, biospecimen, and molecular characterization data from the models, the tissues from which they were derived, and normal tissues, when available. Available harmonized data are accessible through the NCI's [Genomic Data Commons](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/HCMI-CMDC) (GDC), and the models are broadly available through a single third-party distributor, [American Type Culture Collection](https://www.atcc.org/hcmi) (ATCC).

The [HCMI Searchable Catalog](https://hcmi-searchable-catalog.nci.nih.gov/) is a continuously updated resource for querying the available next-generation models developed by HCMI. Within the Catalog, users can search by patient demographics, tumor, and model elements including age at diagnosis, sex, treatment information, clinical tumor diagnosis, primary site, clinical stage, and type of model (e.g. 3D-organoid, 2D-conditionally reprogrammed cells), open-access masked somatic MAF variants, etc. For additional assistance in navigating the Searchable Catalog, please see the “[HCMI Searchable Catalog User Guide](https://ocg.cancer.gov/sites/default/files/HCMI%20Searchable%20Catalog%20User%20Guide_v.5_Clean.pdf)”.
