The Centro di Riferimento Oncologico di Aviano is a National Cancer Institute, reference center for clinicians and researchers in the field of cancer research and cure, and nationally recognized as “Istituto di ricovero e cura a carattere scientifico” (CRO IRCCS) from the Ministry of Health, since 1990.

At CRO IRCCS the main activities are dedicated to the oncological patient’s care, through the development of excellence in prevention, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation. These aims are pursued through multidisciplinary and integrated patient care, high quality standard certifications, advanced personnel training and patient awareness interventions. Most of all, great emphasis and resources are invested to reach high-impact clinical and preclinical research, to boost the translation of bench science into bedside precision care. 

The Molecular Oncology (OM) Unit carries out translational and preclinical research together with providing molecular diagnostics for cancer patients. A lot of the laboratory research is closely linked to clinical practice and utilizes biological material derived from patients. The research activities are focused on the study of the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor onset, metastatic progression and resistance to therapies, particularly in breast and ovarian cancers, where finding new approaches to overcome drug resistance is strongly needed to improve patients’ outcomes.

CRO IRCCS is a founding member of the MoH network "Alliance Against Cancer, ACC”, which comprises all Italian oncological IRCCS and it actively participates to the Patient-derived Cancer Model Collection (ACC-PCMC).
