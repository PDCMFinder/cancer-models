The [Englander Institute for Precision Medicine](https://eipm.weill.cornell.edu/) (EIPM) develops organoids, also known as patient-derived ex-vivo models, used to study disease progression and develop effective drug treatments. These miniature three-dimensional cellular structures are grown from a patientâ€™s tumor sample and are highly useful in studying how different cancers develop, change, and might respond to various treatment options.

For patients with advanced disease, organoids can serve as an ideal platform to enable discoveries of novel therapeutic approaches that can be assessed in clinical trials and provide personalized therapeutic options for individual patients where standard clinical options have been exhausted.

The EIPM has been at the forefront of developing organoid technology that will advance science and speed new treatments to patients.

Our platform is unique because we have advanced the technology to derive organoids from many different types of cancer, unlike many other institutions around the globe. 

We now have >250 pan cancer models in our organoid repository at various stages of characterization. Approximately 150 have been characterized via sequencing and/or pathology review and are now available for research use.

These new cell models and associated datasets be shared with the research community to further research in cancer and other diseases. Genomic datasets as well as model and sample information can be found through the following resources Cell Model Passports Database, [HCMI](https://hcmi-searchable-catalog.nci.nih.gov/) and [GDC](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/)
