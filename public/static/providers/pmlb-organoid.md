Researchers at the Princess Margaret (PM) Cancer Centre (Toronto, Canada) have clinically annotated and molecularly characterized tumor models (>1000) including ovarian, head and neck, lung, mesothelioma, breast, pancreas and colon cancers. Organoid models are derived from patient-derived xenograft tissues, primary tumors, and metastatic patient tissues. PMLB organoid repository includes models generated from colorectal, pancreatic, and lung cancer tissues.

- Each organoid model has been extensively characterized:
- STR matched to patient tissue
- Histopathology
- Mycoplasma testing
- Doubling rate
- Organoid models are accessible to internal/external researchers (view available models)
- OMICS profiling
