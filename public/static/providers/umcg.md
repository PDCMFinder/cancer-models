Researchers at the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG), the Netherlands, aim to identify and validate genes/pathways and their relation to targeted drug and chemotherapy responses in ovarian cancer. In addition, interference in genes and pathways are being explored to enhance drug sensitivity.

We have established an extensive experimental resource of PDXs from primary ovarian cancers covering all different subtypes, coupled with comprehensive molecular annotation including targeted exome sequencing, SNP and methylome analysis. This platform enables discovery of genetic and functional vulnerabilities, which can be targeted in preclinical trials. [... Read more](https://www.rug.nl/research/oncology)
