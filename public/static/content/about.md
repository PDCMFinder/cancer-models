# About

Patient-derived cancer models (PDCMs) are a powerful oncology research platform for studying tumour biology, mechanisms of drug response and resistance and for testing personalised medicine. Distributed nature of repositories for PDCMs (xenografts, organoids and cell lines) and the use of different metadata standards for describing model's characteristics make it difficult for researchers to identify suitable PDCM models relevant to specific cancer research questions. CancerModels.Org platform aims to solve this problem by providing harmonized and integrated model attributes to support consistent searching across the originating resources.

CancerModels.Org (www.cancermodels.org) builds on the success of now retired PDX Finder resource ([PMID:30535239](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30535239/)). Critical PDCM attributes, such as diagnosis, drug names and genes, are harmonized and integrated into a cohesive ontological model based on the PDX Minimal information standard ([PDX-MI](https://www.pdxfinder.org/pdx-standard/), [PMID: 29092942](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29092942/)). PDX MI has become established in the community for data exchange, adopted by the PDX providers, consortia and informatic tools integrating PDX data. We are driving the development of and promoting the use of descriptive standards to facilitate data interoperability and promote global sharing of models. We are working with the community on the Minimal Information standard for 3D cancer models in an effort to make all PDCM datasets adhere to the FAIR data principles. We provide expertise and software components to support several worldwide consortia including PDXNet, PDMR and EurOPDX. CancerModels.Org code is freely available under an Apache 2.0 license ([https://github.com/PDCMFinder](https://github.com/PDCMFinder)). This work is supported by NCI U24 CA204781 01, U24 CA253539, and R01 CA089713.

We welcome feedback on the resource and are looking for participants for usability studies - [please get in touch](mailto:helpdesk@cancermodels.org).
